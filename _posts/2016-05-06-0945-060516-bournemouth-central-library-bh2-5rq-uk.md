09:45 - 06/05/16 - Bournemouth Central Library, BH2 5RQ, UK

It's a bright, warm, sunny day in Bournemouth and as I am sat here overlooking The Triangle area from the library, I see some of the homeless in Bournemouth. I don't understand the growing homelessness situation and I definitely am not sure how I feel about it except conflicted.

I heard that the actual number of homelessness is many times the number published by the UK government reports. So, I decided to do some digging.

The actual government report on the number of people homeless in England (or 'sleeping rough' as it is stated) from 2010 to 2015 , more than doubled from 1768 to 3569.But local agencies give a very different account with their figures. In London alone in the year 2013/14, non-government agencies gave a number of 6508\. In London alone. This number is almost double of the governments figures for the entire area of England in its highest count to date of 3569 in 2015\. Obviously, the governments reports are grossly inaccurate. According to the national charity for homelessness, Crisis: 

"It is difficult to get an absolute figure for the number of people sleeping rough. One reason for this is that, in order to protect themselves, many rough sleepers hide themselves away in places where they might be difficult to find and this is especially true for women. Forty four per cent of current rough sleepers surveyed by [Crisis reported that they had not had any contact with a rough sleepers' team in the past month][0].

Devolution has lead to a divergence in both homelessness legislation and the way in which homelessness statistics are gathered. There are also particularly large numbers of rough sleepers in London."
